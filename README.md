# vim-setup
Repo used to setup my vim environment with vim plugins
through the help of vim-plug

## Clone repo
```
git clone https://github.com/mdcovarr/vim-setup.git
```

# Install
vim setup can be installed by running the **setup.sh** script:
```
cd vim-setup
./setup.sh
```

Now you should have a pretty cool vim interface. If you are interested in which
plug ins were installed take a look at your .vimrc file.

## Uninstall
You can just delete the **plugged** directory and the **plug.vim** file.
```
cd ~
rm -rf ~/.vim/plugged
rm ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim
```


# Also included
I have also included my tmux configuration file it for those who like the layout :)
